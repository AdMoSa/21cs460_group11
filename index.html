<p>Being ardent fans of the Engligh Premier League, the Fantasy Premier League is a great way to keep ourselves invested in the games during the lull between two gameweeks.</p>
<h3 class="w3-center">The Premiership</h3>
<p>The top flight of English Football has 20 teams.Every season each team plays twice against the other teams in a home/away format in about 38 gameweeks spread between August and May. There are about 10 matches per weekend. Each team fields a roster of 11 plus 9 bench players with 3 in match substitutions allowed.<p>
<h3 class="w3-center">Fantasy Premier League</h3>
<p>Is a game played by fans of the premiership where they get to put their managerial hats on and choose a team of 15 players to play against all such other teams in a bid to place the highest in terms of points scored in order to win goodies and most often the bragging rights among friends.<p>
<p>The aim of the game is to chose a well balanced team of 15 players, for a budget fixed and then make one change weekly or two changes bi-weekly in a bid to maximise the points scored. Each week a team of 11 out of the 15 has to be fielded and the captain of the team has to be decided as his points get doubled.
